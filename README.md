## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hashemi221022/customer-segmentation-data/data)
- **Features**:
  - Customer demographics (e.g., Age, Gender, Income)
  - Spending patterns
  - Behavioral metrics

---

## Tools & Techniques
- **Language**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Algorithms**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN
- **Evaluation Methods**:
  - Elbow Method
  - Silhouette Analysis

---

## Key Insights
1. **Cluster Characteristics**:
   - Cluster 1: Young, high spenders.
   - Cluster 2: Older customers with moderate spending.
   - Cluster 3: Budget-conscious customers with infrequent purchases.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - PCA was used to reduce dimensions, improving cluster interpretability.
3. **Optimal Clusters**:
   - Determined using the elbow method and silhouette scores.

## Recommendations
1. **Personalized Marketing**:
   - High spenders: Exclusive offers and loyalty programs.
   - Budget-conscious: Discount campaigns and value-based promotions.
2. **Product Recommendations**:
   - Target product categories based on spending habits.
3. **Enhanced Customer Retention**:
   - Incentives for moderate spenders to increase frequency.
